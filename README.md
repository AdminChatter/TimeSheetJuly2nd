What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

To enter the employees hours you would select the "Company" from the drop-down list on the "Time Card" tab. Then you would click the "Clock In/Clock Out" button. Next, you would go to the "Input" tab. Here the employee would enter in the company name and payrate. After the employee clicked the "Submit" button. They would select the company from the drop-down on the "Payroll" tab. This would then show the employee their total "Hours", "Payrate", and "Total Income."
