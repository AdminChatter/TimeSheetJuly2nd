# # TimeSheet

## Description

The Time Sheet Application is a web-based tool designed to help users track work hours, manage payroll information, and input company details. This application leverages Bootstrap for responsive design and localStorage for persistent data management, providing a user-friendly interface for handling timesheets and payroll information.

- What was your motivation?<br>
   We chose this Timesheet to be our project because it's something that would be useful and secure for many workers in a daily basis, being able to render in many different screen sizes.<br><br>
- Why did you build this project? <br>
   This project is a helping tool for a worker to be rightfully paid by the company they work for. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript<br><br>
- What problem does it solve?<br>
   The Time Sheet Application addresses the common challenges of manually tracking work hours, calculating payroll, and storing company pay rate information. It eliminates the need for paper-based records and manual calculations, reducing errors and saving time for users. The application provides a centralized platform to record work hours, calculate payroll, and manage company data efficiently.<br><br>
- What did you learn?<br>
   Leo: Have learned a lot of javascript and its relation to html; learned how to store and retrieve data using localStorage; learned about event handling in JavaScript, Data Parsing and Manipulation, etc.<br>
   Jason: During the development of the Time Sheet Application, I significantly enhanced my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, particularly through debugging and problem-solving. One of the key concepts I learned was Bootstrap. Its class model proved invaluable, especially in replacing console alert messages with more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing modal dialogs.<br>
